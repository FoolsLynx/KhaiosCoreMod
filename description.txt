Khaios Core is a mod which introduces aspects that make creating Adventure Maps easier. 

The main aspect of the mod, is the Terminal. This works similar to Minecraft's command blocks.
There are current 7 commands that have been added:
- Weather (Gives the ability to set whether it is raining or not as well as sandstorms and slime rain)
- Time (Allows you to adjust the time with set or add commands)
- Item (Gives the ability to add or remove items from player inventories)
- Say (Broadcasts a message to the world)
- Kill (Allows you to kill any Player or NPC within a radius or all Player or NPCs in the world)
- Event (Allows you to trigger the start of any of the default events. Goblin Invasion, Frost Moon, etc)
- Summon (Allows you to summon an NPC based on their name or id to a relative position to the command tile)


Terminal Syntax:

There are a few ways to write a command. Please use this key to help understand what symbols are.
|	- This means or. for example, each command has a long and short way. For example weather has weather or just w.
[]	- These are optional. These will mostly be at the end of commands.
""	- Anything inside quotations requires quotations around it. For example if getting an item, if you do "Iron Shortsword" it will correctly find it
~	- This means relative. This is related to X and Y coords. So if a command says ~X then the number to enter will be relative to the x coord. For example, if the tile is at X: 2000 and the command is -20 the relative position would be 1980.
()	- This means the command is a number. For example (Radius) you need to replace that with a number.
